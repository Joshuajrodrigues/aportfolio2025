ActOut is a magazine concept focusing on highlighting talent in non-mainstream music. The magazine brings readers articles, reviews and features dedicated to artists and their music that deserves a spot on your playlist. An issue every month, will allow readers to spend time with the artists as well as with the music in way it deserves, slowly and through a non-overwhelming way. Physical magazines are a great way to clear out the noise of social media and dedicate your attention to where it deserves to be, on the hidden genius of the musical artists of our time.

# Why design a magazine?
Magazines have always been the most integral part of my life, and of so many kids and adults like me. I have fond memories of my mother and I reading together every evening. She would read her magazines and I’d read my children’s magazines. There was a certain welcoming quality to holding a magazine that is catered to your interest even as a child. Not to mention, physical media is fast disappearing but that hasn’t ever discounted on the reasons why they deserve to be a part of every human’s life. Regardless of trends and loss of interest, physical magazines and the limitations like losing out on quick trends due to the time it takes to make them, are the reason why we need them now more than ever. Even with ten thousand recommendations at our finger tips every second of ever day, we are never any closer to discovering artists that are interesting and wild and free and making amazing music beneath the ginormous pressure and noise of trends. Those are the voices that encouraged me to work on a magazine for artists that i believe in.

(Years after I’ve made this magazine, it brings me great joy to see the artists I featured here are still thriving and reaching bigger heights)

# Straying away from the mainstream, with design

For the design of the magazine, I wanted to let the spirit of straying from mainstream take the wheel. When it comes to the colors and the layouts, i wanted to follow the philosophy that less is more, but also letting the concept of rest also enter the space. Every page being covered in text would overwhelm even the calmest of music enthusiasts. 

Using green is an attempt to grab the readers passing by a stall and help them associate it easily with certain streaming giants that already solidify their identity with their branding. The hope is that a lot of people can comfortable associate music in a similar color profile that they already operate everyday. But, within the magazine using text layout and the use of the images of the artists and imagery that highlights their albums further, ActOut stands out on its own two feet. 

Understanding the artists through their music and the message they want to convey is the magazines strength and that is in fact the reason why our recommendations aren’t made lightly. The magazine believes in the artists and brings them to you every month. Every design decision, choice of quotes used and the imagery expressed are brought onto the page keeping in mind the artists intention but also the magazines purpose.
