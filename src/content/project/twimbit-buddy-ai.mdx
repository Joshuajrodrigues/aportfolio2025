# Creating for the team and uncovering a star product
While I was working at Twimbit, there was a requirement to build something unique and helpful for the internal team as well leveraging AI. It was originally slated to become a part of the internal CMS infrastructure to encourage efficient creation and lessen friction between writing and hitting publish. The leadership team brainstormed the idea for what the tool would include and called upon the larger team to support it’s creation.

I led the design for the a tool which retained it’s working title as, Buddy. A powerful AI chat-bot platform that aggregates leading generative AI models—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and others—into one seamless interface. The platform combined multi-model capabilities with Twimbit’s proprietary industry insights, making it a one-stop tool for advanced AI interaction and business intelligence. It would also include in-built & custom assistants that service the need for common workflows and also allow you to create a custom one that perfectly fits your needs.

As soon as we have developed a prototype version of this, the stakeholders were starting to see this as a potential product to introduce to our clients as a standalone sale. It could be a one-stop solution to the distributed AI landscape create a single point interface to access all the latest models all the while being enhanced by Twimbit’s  research and insights.

# Collaboration and care for the process

This project became a personal undertaking of mine as i was encouraged to step to the plate once again to take charge. I was tasked with finding our any bottlenecks for our team in not using the CMS and it’s editor to it’s full extent, their hesitation with using AI tools and to map their overall workflow so that we can aid them. 

I spoke with a small group of the research team members and performed a more approachable version of a user interview. We informally and casually discussed their workflow one by one, letting them elaborate as much as they’d wish on each step. There was also input taken from them for what sort of issues, a tool like Buddy would have to cater to, for them to have high use of it. Documenting all these points helped the Buddy team( consisting of the tech team, myself and our main stakeholder) to define the tool and the solution it provides more clearly.

Next the collaboration between the developer team and myself was crucial to ensure that Buddy would be a great amalgamation of aspiration and feasibility. I worked closely with the AI team and the Front-end team to ensure clear communication at every step. And the end of it, we had a tool that was ready to be launched to the internal team, but also having caught the eye of the stakeholders, Buddy was ready to fly a great deal higher and further than just it’s home grounds.
