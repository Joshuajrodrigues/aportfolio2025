At Twimbit, I was the sole UI/UX designer for the entirety of my journey. My role involved collaborating closely with the founders and understanding their vision for the fast-growing landscape of their company. They had a product they were passionate about - one that was evolving quickly with the rise of AI.

# A truly evolutionary journey
The task required plenty of skill from an in-house designer - but also a strategic thinker. When it came to the website, the company required someone to take ownership of the situation, work across multiple departments, navigate the diverse needs of multiple stakeholders and be ready to fill in the gaps wherever they may pop up. In short, someone who could ride the wild waves of the beautiful, dynamic chaos that is the fast-growing start-up environment where a launch-on deadline is always looming. I, being the only UIUX designer in our squad was tasked with wearing all the hats needed to get the job done.’

Despite the requirements evolving and tight deadlines and the first few launches being within the existing design infrastructure; saw improvements immediately with double-digit event occurrences across the entire website. The changes were proving beneficial to pitch Twimbit’s use case to clients through a easy to run-through messaging.

# All the hats

Ultimately, we settled on revamping the entire design system and branding for the company. I was part of that process as well and worked with a Malaysia-based design firm that helped us nail our design philosophy with our stakeholders inputs in mind.

Using this philosophy and new design system, i worked on building dozens of pages and micro sites, shepherded the re-brand internally and even coached a few new design recruits to get familiar with the way of life within the company. When i saw that the business needs and vision were evolving and changing with the times, I was involved in proposing additional changes and upgrades across the entire website structure.

# In conclusion

In the end, the website was something that ended up being the closest to the stakeholders vision and messaging. The iterative approach, taking the time to understand the reality of our positioning in the industry and striking while the iron is hot is what helped us in reaching the goal eventually.

Toward the end of my time at Twimbit, the main website was already on auto-pilot with several of the other micro-sites ready to launch or launched already. This collection of websites became a point of experience for me personally as managing the messaging, tone and vision for the collective good but also the individual arc of the story helped me learn how to lead and become the birds-eye view to the multi-page vista.
