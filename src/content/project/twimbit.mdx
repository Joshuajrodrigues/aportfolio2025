## Background
Twimbit is a tech-forward research and advisory firm that harnesses the powers of AI. It delivers a private and contextual platform to its client that helps them excel as leaders in their domain through accessing industry insights in various formats.

At Twimbit, I was the sole UI/UX designer for the entirety of my journey. My role involved collaborating closely with the founders and understanding their vision for the fast-growing landscape of their company. They had a product they were passionate about - one that was evolving quickly with the rise of AI. 

## Scope of my role
I oversaw their company website and also was responsible for the design and maintenance of both the companyâ€™s core platform and the custom solutions delivered to clients. This required continuous refinement and upgrading of the UI to meet the emerging demands from clients. This role required me to ideate, iterate, and distill the core essence of features while uncovering real user needs. 

Some of the projects I worked on were:
- Buddy.ai
- Twimbit company website
- Twimbit insights platform
- Sparks - Merchandise project
- Twimbit Telecom Awards 2025 website and
- Client instances of our platform (custom and private)
