# Merchandise that unites and inspires
The Sparks project began as a humble merchandise design task for the internal team for the upcoming team offsite. I saw an opportunity to upgrade the overall experience of a company merchandise being received by the employees into something that actually facilitates a dialogue about growth and inspiration. I took a big swing and asked the stakeholders to allow me to give them a pitch about something that could be a long term, memorable merchandise asset that, if successful internally, could also grow to be a bridge to engage clients with. All this sounded very out there and hard to wrap your heads around at the verbal discussion stages, but I was passionate and excited to put in the extra effort required to distill the idea down to a digestible pitch deck for the entire team. It was nerve wracking that the team ended up being all of the stakeholders/ co-founders. I worked on the pitch deck to encapsulate the idea I had into something executable.'

Sparks, was a initiative that would show the growth of talent and innovative spirit in the employees at Twimbit. There would be 4 stages, each stage symbolizing the growing aspects of employees who have just joined to seasoned team members that are now beginning to echo their ideas and spirit through Twimbit out into the world. This would be symbolized into illustrated pieces of a hibiscus flower, a spark and convey a more younger aesthetic in terms of what items theyâ€™d feature on (e.g graphic t shirts, hoodies, sweatpants etc.)

# Covering ground and bringing the idea together

I was joined by a talented designer who had joined us recently and would take over the illustrations and together we came up with iterations upon iterations till we knew we had something special. With input at every stage from the stakeholders we knew it was headed in a direction that was faithful to the original idea in my head but also to the business ambitions and limitations. We finally put together a version we were happy with and wanted it to go into the sampling process. (I even did some of the calling out to vendors in India and China myself :P). And at the end we had some options locked and loaded for t-shirts and hoodies to go along with a tote bag. The experience of the packaging would also be added to by a small 6 page zine that would encapsulate the entire Sparks story into it and attach the story to the employees time at Twimbit.


# Enjoying the journey, not just the result

Though by the time it was time for me to leave, the stakeholders had to decide to forgo the designs and the Sparks motif had been altered to faciliate a much more reduced scope, i was still ultimately extremely proud of what we had acheived. Seeing as this was my first merchandising project in a company setting with various factors in terms of resources, I wanted to leave feeling as though I had done my part in doing justice to the project and the idea right up to the end.
