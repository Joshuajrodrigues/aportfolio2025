In my town, there is a convenience store that tries to figure out what you need, before you even walk in. They have a basket delivered to your door every week, with a receipt made of cloth. The amount and details are stitched into it. And it reads at the bottom; Tell Us How We Did. At first, people were confused. Some even angry at the presumptions being made. But most people over time thought, learned to tolerate, enjoy and accept the groceries. The mode of payment reflected the town’s change of heart very well. The store asked everyone to put their money in an envelope and slide it under the doors of the store. The doors were never open. Only a soft glow emanated from the store itself. No one ever saw anyone go in or out of the store. But the glow always came on when the sun began setting.

I felt a little left out when the whole town was talking about the ‘guessing convenience store’, but I was yet to receive a delivery. Every day I waited, and I found nothing in front of my door.

On a late evening when I was returning home from work, I decided to go visit the convenience store. I had seen it maybe once, in the daytime. But today, I was curious about this glow people spoke of. When I arrived at the street, the warm light washing over the street made the dark, motionlessness of the night feel very inviting. It provokes you to curiosity and brings you toward it. When I stood in front of the store, I saw no movement behind the plain glass doors. The light inside was like a dense fog, creating only an outward direction. I don’t know what I was hoping for, but I wanted my own grocery store basket. Did people unknowingly sign up? Did I miss out on some procedure? I couldn’t think of anything. And so, I left.

The next morning, I opened the door as I had for the past several days. But today, there was something. Not a grocery basket, but a little box. I picked it up and took it inside. I sat at the table and took a look at this very simple purple box. I tried to find any labels or marks, but there was nothing on it. I gently opened the box and found a neatly folded piece of cloth. And nothing else, I undid the folds and found a massage, stitched into the cloth. It read, 

_Hello,_

_We are pleased to inform you of your apprenticeship appointment at our store. We do not choose our apprentices lightly and want to explain how we made our decision._

_At the store, we value the human condition. We put it on even ground and not let it seem like a flaw to fix. When we sent out our supply baskets, we hope to come closer to the residents of the towns we visit. Our intention is to partake in the joy of being thought of, cared for, and looked after._

_When you visited us last night, it marked an important night for us, where we finally accepted you to be worthy of being an apprentice. Something brought you to us, something kept you opening your door to look for our basket. That need for wanting to be part of something is in us all. That is in fact why the store is alive everywhere we go. But very few choose to pay us a visit even without receiving from us. Even without a payment to clear. You seek in us an answer. You reached your hand out to us, and thus we reach back to you._

_Your posting will be in the town across the river. We hope to bring the next town the same thing we have brought you. A place that someone in need can reach for._

Reading this I felt a strange sense of warmth and confusion. The store reached out to me? An apprentice? I couldn’t quite wrap my head around it. The rest of the morning, I tried to go back to my routine. I dressed, ate and decided to go to work as usual. Walking out, watching door after door open and receiving boxes felt even stranger than it did the first time. All day at work I remained largely distracted and focused on the letter folded in my pocket. I kept wanting to check to see if I had dreamt it up. But my hands eventually tussled with the fabric and ended my doubt time and time again. Then, it was time for me to head home. I stayed in my distraction, longer than I usually do and made it out to dark town roads lit in bright welcoming colors. But as I was walking, I noticed the lights grew dimmer and dimmer finally to the darkness of a now familiar street in front of me. The only light, was down the street, coming from the convenience store.

I approached it, standing in front as I had stood yesterday. The light was just the same, allowing no movement inside to be betrayed. I stared into the light and reached into my pocket for the note. As I unfolded the letter, I heard a slash. The light was brighter and now falling over my body. When I looked up, I saw that the convenience store had opened its doors.
